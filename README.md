# Real-time-traffic-prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-DeepLearning-Algorithms

Tech stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib. 

The main Goal was to Predict traffic congestion in real-time using ML and DL models by integrating live traffic and weather data.

The workflow involved collecting dataset and preprocessing it, which included handling missing values and engineering time-series features such as lag features and moving averages. I implemented machine learning models like Support Vector Regression and Random Forest, and also applied deep learning using LSTM since traffic data is sequential and LSTMs are effective in capturing temporal dependencies. The models were evaluated using metrics like RMSE and MAE, and LSTM. The outcome final was an improved congestion forecasting system that can support data-driven traffic management and help optimize city planning.
